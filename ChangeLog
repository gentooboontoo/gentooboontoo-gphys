Thu Jul 26  2007  T Horinouchi
	* gphys_netcdf_io.rb: NetCDF_IO::write : changed to write command 
	  name (File.basename($0)), rather than the method name, to the
	  global attribute 'history'.
Wed Jul 25  2007  T Horinouchi
	* ggraph.rb: improved default color-bar labeling for log-scale:
	  to simply use chval format 'b', rather than using

Tue Jul 24  2007  T Horinouchi
	* axis.rb: added a new class method Axis.humane_message=
	  to disable the humane messaging by [] (By defalut,
	  lost time axis info is expressed in a chronological

	* subsetmapping.rb: to use Array#values_at instead of
	  Array#indices, which is obsolete and warned in Ruby 1.8.
	  (note: Array#values_at is a ruby 1.8 feature.)
	* varray.rb: VArray#val: to support negative array index 
	  with step (by using Hash) for NArray-type data.
Wed Jul 18  2007  Y Morikawa
	* bin/gpedit: Create or overwrite the attributes of a variable

	  'flow_vect' are exchanged in GGraph::vector. 
	  In GGraph::title, action of the case of itr==5 changed. 
	  In flow_itr5, unit_vector option is added. 
	* bin/gpvect: commnad for 2D vector field plotting, optionally with 
	  contour/tone of scalar field newly created.

      (save and restore x/yfact, x/yoffset)
Tue Jul 4   2007  S Takehiro
        * lib/numru/ggraph.rb: Added a new method DCLExt.flow_itr5 to draw 
	  a 2D vector filed on the polor coordinate. GGraph::vector was 
	  modified to call this method. 
	  GGraph::vector is fixed to perform the axes exchange before 
	  rank inquirey. 
Tue Jun 26  2007  T Horinouchi
	* lib/numru/vizshot.rb: Added a new tone_cont option 
	  "color_bar_options", which takes options of
	  GGraph::color_bar as a Hash. To test it, try the test menu 6 by
	    % ruby vizshot.rb 6
Tue Jun 26  2007  T Horinouchi
	* lib/numru/vizshot.rb: Added a logarithmic color-bar option:
	  * If a GGraph option 'log' is given to VizShot#tone_cont,
	    it was made to be passed to GGraph::color_bar in addition
	    to GGraph::tone etc. 
	    (Therefore, at this moment, only the "log" option
	    of color_bar was supported. I'm also planning to
	    support any color_bar options.)

Mon Jun 25  2007  T Horinouchi
	* axis.rb Axis#[]  
	  * supported units compatible with "months" (e.g.
	    year, pentad) with since fields.
	  * debug and minor improvement of "day"-compatible
	    units (second,hour,...) with since fields, 
	    which was supported on jun 21 2007.

Thu Jun 21  2007  T Horinouchi
	* axis.rb Axis#[] : changed the lost-axis descripting
	  string, when the axis is a time one, whose units
	  has a "since" field. In that case, string to be returned 
	  was changed to a date time in the form of
	  "%Y-%m-%d %M:%H:%S%z" (formatted by strftime).
Thu Jun 21  2007  R Mizuta
	* grads_gridded.rb: error massage when ctl file and binary 
      are inconsistent. 
Thu Jun 21  2007  T Horinouchi
	* ggraph.rb: Added calendar-type time axis support.
	  * Added new option "time_ax" for GGraph::axes, where
	    * nil (defalut): Draws calendar-type time axis if 
	      the unit of an axis is time one with the "since"
	      field (such as "hours since 2006-01-01").
	      Auto selects "h" or "ymd" below, depending on the
	      length of the period (current thres: 5 days).
	    * false: Do not use the time axis regardless the units
	    * 'h': When the units allow (see the description for nil),
	      always use the hour-resolving time axis datetime_ax
	      in dclext_datetime_ax.rb)
	    * 'ymd': When the units allow (see the description for nil),
	      always use the y-m-d type axis using DCL.uc[xy]acl.
Tue May 22  2007  T Horinouchi
	* ggraph.rb: Added a new option 'keep' in GGraph::contour, 
	  GGraph::tone, GGraph:vector (defalut val: false). If its value
	  is set true, the contour levels / tone levels & patterns / 
	  vector scaling, respectively, are set to be the same
	  as in the previous call. GOOD FOR ANIMATION.
	  Also, a minor debug was made in contour -- handling of 'lmsg'
	  in log scaling.
Wed May 9  2007  T Horinouchi
	* gphys.rb: GPhys#average etc (in Axis.defined_operations).
	  debug not to cause error when the result is scalar
	  (to return the scalar itself -- behavior unified with 
	  mean etc)

Tue Apr 24  2007  T Horinouchi
	* varray.rb: debug in replace_val (replace_val was not effective
	  for subset VArray); added explicit error for VArray subclasses
	  such as VArrayNetCDF.

	* gphys-0.5.4 released (cvs tag gphys-0_5_4)

Mon Dec 12  2006  T Horinouchi
	* gphys_fft.rb: added a class method fft_ignore_missing: this is
	  to set a flag (class variable) to ignore missing values. 
	  This is for data that actually do not have missing 
	  but is treated as potentially having missing (often
	  by having the valid_* attributes of NetCDF.)

Mon Dec 12  2006  T Horinouchi
	* ggraph.rb: 
	  * GGraph.tone,GGraph.contour: Added option 'log'
	  * DCLExt : added new method quasi_log_levels and quasi_log_levels_z
            (driver of quasi_log_levels with data values)
Mon Dec 11  2006  T Horinouchi
	* ggraph.rb: Added options 'legend' etc to GGraph.line and GGraph.mark
	  to annotate the line/mark type and index (and size if mark).
	  ('legend', 'legend_vx', 'legend_dx' (only for line), 'legend_vy', 
          'legend_size') By defualt it is shown in the right margin of vpt.
	  'legend' is a String to show, or true to show the name of the
	  current GPhys object.
	  * DCLExt : added new method legend

	* ggraph.rb: Applied the patches made by T Koshiro;
	  * 002687: map-fitting (with option 'map_fit') and axes-drawing
	    (with option 'map_axes') were made available
	    simultaneously when itr=10.
	  * 002690: added axis-drwaing options: 'xmaplabel', 'ymaplabel' 
	    better axis-labelling when itr==10, with 90E, 90W, etc instead

	* gphys.rb : *temporarily* disabled the modification on Jun 16:
	  >>  not to take 
	  >>    na_other = self.data.val.fill(other)
          >>  which is inefficitent. But this would require a
  	  by re-activating l.636 (be removing comment-out chars).
	  Plus, a minor debug of an enbug on Jun 16.
Fri Jun 17  2005   T Horinouchi < S Takeshiro

	* gphys.rb : GPhys#coerce modified
	  * not to take 
	      na_other = self.data.val.fill(other)
            which is inefficitent. But this would require a
	    future new version of NArrayMiss (later than 1.1.1)
	  * set nil to units of a Numric/NArray for
	    correct units handling bor both add/sub and mlt/div (see below).
	* varray.rb : 
	  * Binary_operators_Uconv (+,-,add!,sbt!) : to use other's units
	    if 'units' attribute is emtpy (nil), rather than interpreting
	    it as '1' (non-dimension).
	  * collect a typo: sub!(which is non-exitent in NArray) --> sbt!
	* grid.rb : added Grid#merge

	* gdir_connect_ftp-like.rb: very minor change in URL handling
	  (chomp -> strip)
	* bin/gdir_server: changed the default behavior to allow
	  connections only from the localhost. (You need specify

Mon Jun  6  2005   T Horinouchi < S Otsuka
	* gphys_netcdf_io.rb: NetCDF_IO::open : improved handling of
	  files without coordinate variables. (add "_#{dim}" to 
	  the automatically generated name "noname")
Mon Jun  6  2005   T Horinouchi
	* gphys_io_common.rb: IO_Common::each_along_dims_write : changed to
	  use the new grid obtained with *_IO::write_grid
          [It solves the problem reported by T Koshiro
          (Subject: GPhys::NetCDF_IO.each_along_dims_write
          Date: Wed, 27 Apr 2005 11:00:40 +0900)]
	* gphys_netcdf_io.rb: GPhys::NetCDF_IO::write_grid : changed
	  to return a Grid object, in which all VArrays in the original
	  grid are replaced with the new ones in the file (the return
	  value used to be nil).
	* axis.rb: added methods Axis#each_varray, Axis#collect.
Mon May 30  2005   T Horinouchi (thanks to T Koshiro)
	* ggraph.rb: GGraph#(tone|contour|vector): debug in

	  changed to accept lower-case "z" (which is leagal).
	* grads_gridded.rb: GrADSVar#initialize: added attribute 
	  'missing_value', which is 'undef' in GrADS_Gridded.
	* grads_gridded.rb: GrADS_Gridded#parse_ctl: change in the
	  relative path intepretation: to deal with path without
	  '^' at the beginning (BEFORE: '^hoge' -> absolute path,
	  'hoge' -> remained relative; AFTER: both -> absolute path.
	  So you don't need to be at the data directory anymore.)
Tue May 24  2005   T Horinouchi
	* grads_gridded.rb: GrADS_Gridded#get_dim: to use float for
 	  spacial dimensions as well as time.
	  GrADSVar#vartype: to return 'float' for coordinate variables.

	  (requires numru-misc-0.0.6 or later)
	* bin/gdir_server: added option to explicitly specify host address
	* gdir.rb: sort gdirs and texts in list_*; plus, a very minor change
	* gdir_connect_ftp-like.rb: start_dcl: to call 
	  DCL.swpset('lwait',false) (if you don't like it, you don't need to
	  use start_dcl.)
Wed May 11  2005   T Horinouchi
	* Merged gphys-remote-0.4 in gphys:
	  * commands bin/gdir_server and bin/gdir_client
	    (the former was renamed from gdir_server.rb in gphys-remote).
	  * irb start-up file lib/numru/gdir_connect_ftp-like.rb
            (renamed from gphys_connect_ftp-like.rb in gphys-remote).
Tue May 10  2005   T Horinouchi
	* ggraph.rb: GGraph's visualization methods are changed to call
	  DCL.gropn(1) if gropn/sgopn has not been called
	  (by introducing GGraph::gropn_1_if_not_yet).
	* gdir.rb: Added GDir.pwd, GDir#each_dir, GDir#each_data.
          show, show_v are reorganized and renamed to list_all,
	  list_all_v, which returns the result as strings.
	  ls / ls_l now prints their results.

	* ggraph.rb: separated annotate_at from annotate
Fri Apr 15  2005   T Horinouchi
	* ggraph.rb: Further modification for map projection:
	  The strategy of the previous edition was not good.
	  If map is to be drawn, 'itr' should be 10 and axes should be drawn
	  afterwards. Eliminated the new "map" and introduced "map_axes".
Fri Apr 15  2005   T Horinouchi
	* lib/numru/gdir.rb: added GDir#open_all_data. Renamed ls_v ->
	  ls_l, which I originally meant. Supported path in show, show_v.
	  Support the path argument in show and show_v
	* gphys_io.rb: corrrected a spell miss of method name in documentation
	* ggraph.rb: Revision regarding map projection:
	  * GGraph::fig: Option changed from map_lat_range -> map_window
	    (the latter includes log-lat range, and the former is eliminated).
	    Added new option 'map_fit', which is for itr=10 and 11.
	    Changed the default behavior for itr=10 (cylindrical) to fit
            the map to the data window (equiv to 'map_fit'=>true). 
	    Concequently, the default window for itr=10 is now the same as 
	    with itr=1.
	  * GGraph::tone & GGraph::contour: added option 'map_fit', 
	    which draws map etc by switching temporarilly to itr=10 and
	    calling GGraph::map.
	* sample/map_projection.rb: Revised according to the change 
	  of ggraph.rb. New samples were added regarding the 'map_fit'
	  option of fig and the 'map' option of tone/contour.
	* doc/: updated
Wed Apr 13  2005   T Horinouchi
	* lib/numru/gdir.rb: Imported (moved) from gphys-remote-0.3. It will be

	  * attributenetcdf.rb: AttributeNetCDF#initialize to extend
	    Attribute_Mixin whose default is defined in netcdf_convention.rb
	  * netcdf_convention.rb: created module Attribute_Mixin
	    in NetCDF_Convention_Users_Guide. Moved contents of 
	    VArray_Mixin to Attribute_NetCDF, which is to move
	    attribute editor on copying (deep-cloning) from VArrayNetCDF
	    to AttributeNetCDF (which is used in VArrayNetCDF).
	* grads_gridded.rb: minor revision of documentation.
	  allowed modes: "r" & "w+" --> "r" & "w" (read only / write only).
	* doc/: updated

	  introduced in the write method)
Thu Mar 31  2005   T Horinouchi
	* grib.rb: minor update of Grib#initialize (to refuse "w+"; 
	  corresponding error message at l.1268; documentation of file mode).

	  methods was eliminated, so to add some has to be done before
	  Grid or GPhys is loaded.
	* grid.rb,gphys.rb: minor changes corresponding to the change in
